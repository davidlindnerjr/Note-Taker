# Note-Taker

## Description

Note-Taker is an application that allows the user to write, save, and delete notes. When writing a note the user enters a title and text; when the user is finished writing they press the save icon in the upper right-hand corner and the note is sent and saved to the data base and the title will appear of the left-hand side. To analyze a note previously written the user clicks on the note title on the left-hand side. To delete a note the user can select a note from the left-hand side and click the corresponding trash icon; the note will be deleted from the data base and will no longer appear to the left.

This project was one of the more stressful ones I have completed. Understanding express is one thing, creating routes and so on, but connecting to a database is a challenge all in itself. The biggest hurdle I had was connecting express routes/ calls to the local .json file used as the database. I tried to trouble shoot with YouTube tutorials and stackoverflow but they were all dealing with either an external database or an array initialized within the app.js file itself. Finally, I was able to figure it out and I learned quite a bit so I believe I got some invaluable knowledge and practice when I was troubleshooting.
